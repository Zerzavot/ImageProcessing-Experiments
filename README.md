# ImageProcessing-Experiments
This project uses some image processing techniques. You can find application of these operations in ipynb file:
Noise removal, Image enhancement, Contrast enhancement, Histogram equalization, Sharpening, Application of contra-harmonic mean and gaussian filter, Morphological operations.

### Task 1
Task description: Work on the degraded image and apply image restoration (noise removal) techniques to remove noise.

### Task 2
Task description: Enhance the output from Task 1 in terms of contrast.

### Task 3
Task description: Analyze the image and find out if you can enhance this image for visual appeal.

### Task 4
Task description: Convert the image to grayscale. Then, apply thresholding to produce a binary image.Then, apply dilation, erosion, closing, and opening morphological operations on the binary image.
